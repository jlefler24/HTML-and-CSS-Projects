		<p>
			A cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses 
			cryptography to secure financial transactions. Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control 
			as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			The decentralized control of each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger
			technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.
		</p>
